# Animal Buyer

Animal Jam Classic animal browser and buyer.

## Animal data

The animal database was derived from Animal Jam Classic's animal definition data.

Animal definitions:
- Defpack: 1003

Animal names:
- Text/string pack: 10230

The `id` field from defpack 1003 is the Animal ID used by the plugin.

The `titleStrRef` field is resolved through defpack 10230 to obtain the animal name.

## Purchase packet

The request includes fields from the current game session, so the plugin does
not use a hard-coded packet. Make a normal animal purchase in the game first;
Animal Buyer captures that outgoing request and substitutes only the selected
Animal ID. The captured template is kept in memory for the current plugin
session and is discarded when the plugin closes.

The generated request is editable. The Purchase button sends the text currently
in the packet field, after checking that it is an outgoing `aa` packet with a
numeric Animal ID. After sending, check the game for the server's result; a
successful send only confirms that Jam Reborn passed the request to the active
game connection.
